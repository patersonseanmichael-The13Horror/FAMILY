            <p>For too long, we walked in the shadow of the <b>lean times</b>. We felt the cold bite of material scarcity—that quiet, heavy weight of trying to harvest hope from barren ground while the world moved on without us. We were many spirits drifting in the wind, separated by the ache of the struggle.</p>
            <p>But even in the seasons of hunger, the Old Ways whispered. They told us that true abundance isn't gathered in a storehouse, but in the hands that hold yours. Through faith in our traditional power and the breath of our ancestors, we are coming home. We are trading the "me" for "us."</p>

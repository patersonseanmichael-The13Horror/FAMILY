    <article>
        <p>In the quiet spaces where ancient deserts and silent fjords merged, a family stood ground. They were nine souls bound by an impossible love and protected by a shimmering memory: the Rainbow Serpent, Melinda. The land around them was shifting, a mythic rift where time itself seemed to fracture. The ground was unstable, vibrating with a deep, cosmic sorrow, but their connection was an anchor.</p>

        <p>Sean, the big Norwegian, anchored the center, his bald head gleaming under the competing auroras. His Viking heart, once seeking conquest, now sought only stability for this beautiful kin. Surrounding him was the diverse strength of the family. Gennia, looking like a black Dora, and magic-boy deSean, held the line. But the energy was always high, always rough—especially with 8-year-old Cameron keeping everyone on their toes.</p>

        <p>And that was <strong>Xylon’s</strong> job. At 21, Xylon was a biggish fella with shoulders broad enough to carry any load, but a spirit too light for the heavy sorrow threatening their ground. He was the joker. As the others braced against the spiritual gale, Xylon moved differently. He was <span class="gammin">"gammininin"</span>—refusing to let the overwhelming situation break their joy. He made faces at 16-year-old deSean, nudged the serious-faced 17-year-old Shakia, and kept 5-year-old AA, the wild daffodil/thorn bush, giggling when she should have been afraid.</p>

        <p>Xylon was the pressure valve. In the height of the struggle, when their grip was slipping, he didn't fight *harder* against the world; he fought *for* their joy. His 'gammin' smile was as grounded as any warrior's shield. They were warrior and forager, Viking and Merlin, bound by a shared strength and an irreducible, overwhelming joy, anchored together against the beautiful, sad, magic world.</p>

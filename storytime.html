            <p>Listen to the sand. At Rainbow Beach, the Great Spirit didn't just pass through; she bled her colors into the cliffs to protect us. This is the place where the Rainbow Serpent took the blow for a woman in need, shattering her own body into the dunes to prove that love is the ultimate law.</p>
            <p>She is the <b>'Deadly' protector</b>. She reminds us that even when we are broken into a thousand colors, we are still beautiful, we are still sacred, and we are still here. She is the bridge between the Sky World and the Deep Water. When she moves, we move. When she rests, we find peace.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>This is not a myth; it is our heartbeat.</b></p>
